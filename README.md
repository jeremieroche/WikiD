# WikiD

**WikiD** is a python package to access Wikipedia locally and get information useful for Natural Language Processing in a way not possible with other wikipedia packages.

Wikipedia is accessible locally (as opposed to a web interface) primarily for speed reasons.I wanted the API to iterate through 100,000 pages in less than a minute for instance. Having Wikipedia locally also allows me to enrich it with information not stored in wikipedia pages (such as 'reverse links', i.e. Wikipedia links that point to the page rather than links that are in the page).

(See the WikiD_Demonstration.ipynb page for an extended explanation)
